I finally deployed this Hugo based site on Github. It was surprisingly easy. All I had to do was follow the [instruction](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) on the Hugo website. 

Adding a custom domain was easy too. You can't go wrong following this [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
