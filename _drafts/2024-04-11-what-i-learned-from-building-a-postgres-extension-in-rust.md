This is a list of things I learned from building the [Postgres-redis](https://github.com/systemEng-Learning/postgres-redis) extension for Postgres in Rust. A retrospective design and implementation article, this is not. I wrote that up [here]().

Building this extension opened my eyes to some of Postgres's design details and Rust tricks. The things I learned might be ordinary and widely known, but I learned about them on this project. Here's what I learned.

#### 1. The Mundanity Of Excellence
Take a look at this piece of code:

```c
/*
	 * Loop until we've processed the proper number of tuples from the plan.
	 */
	for (;;)
	{
		/* Reset the per-output-tuple exprcontext */
		ResetPerTupleExprContext(estate);

		/*
		 * Execute the plan and obtain a tuple
		 */
		slot = ExecProcNode(planstate);

		/*
		 * if the tuple is null, then we assume there is nothing more to
		 * process so we just end the loop...
		 */
		if (TupIsNull(slot))
			break;

		/*
		 * If we have a junk filter, then project a new tuple with the junk
		 * removed.
		 *
		 * Store this new "clean" tuple in the junkfilter's resultSlot.
		 * (Formerly, we stored it back over the "dirty" tuple, which is WRONG
		 * because that tuple slot has the wrong descriptor.)
		 */
		if (estate->es_junkFilter != NULL)
			slot = ExecFilterJunk(estate->es_junkFilter, slot);

		/*
		 * If we are supposed to send the tuple somewhere, do so. (In
		 * practice, this is probably always the case at this point.)
		 */
		if (sendTuples)
		{
			/*
			 * If we are not able to send the tuple, we assume the destination
			 * has closed and no more tuples can be sent. If that's the case,
			 * end the loop.
			 */
			if (!dest->receiveSlot(slot, dest))
				break;
		}

		/*
		 * Count tuples processed, if this is a SELECT.  (For other operation
		 * types, the ModifyTable plan node must count the appropriate
		 * events.)
		 */
		if (operation == CMD_SELECT)
			(estate->es_processed)++;

		/*
		 * check our tuple count.. if we've processed the proper number then
		 * quit, else loop again and process more tuples.  Zero numberTuples
		 * means no limit.
		 */
		current_tuple_count++;
		if (numberTuples && numberTuples == current_tuple_count)
			break;
	}
```
Pretty ordinary, with no clever tricks, just straightforward C code. This piece of code [taken](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/b1b13d2b524e64e3bf3538441366bdc8f6d3beda/src/backend/executor/execMain.c#L1638) from Postgres is responsible for inserting/updating/deleting/selecting tuples (rows) from a table. It's pretty amazing how simple it is, yet almost all select/update/delete/insert queries you run against your Postgres table execute this code. It wasn't just this area; other parts of the Postgres codebase were like this. Simple pieces of code that are combined to create excellent, reliable, sophisticated, and amazing software. It reminds me of Da Vinci's quote: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

#### 2. So Many Kinds Of Operators
Take a look at [this](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/3741f2a09d5205ec32bd8af5d1f397e08995932b/src/include/catalog/pg_operator.dat#L100). Postgres has lots of operators. Initially, I thought the `=` sign would only have one constant. I could not have been more mistaken. There are Int4EqualOperator, TextEqualOperator, NameEqualTextOperator, BooleanEqualOperator, TIDEqualOperator, BpcharEqualOperator, ByteaEqualOperator, and this is just for the equal sign. Other operators have different subtypes, with each subtype having its own oid.

It made our where clause handler a bit more complex but I can't complain. I'm curious about the reason for this though. Please, I'd love to hear from you if you know :-).

#### 3. Rust Pointers
Working on this project introduced me to using pointers in Rust lots of time. In an unsafe context, Rust pointers behave so much like C. While the basic pointer stuff like referencing and dereferencing pointers are covered well by the Rust [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer), there are two things I learned about Rust pointers when building this extension. Here they are:

* Pointer arithmetic: Imagine you have a list of objects and the pointer to the first item in the list; how do you get to the nth item? In C, you'd probably do this:

```c
struct object* get_nth(struct object* list, int n) {
    struct object* item = list + n;
    return item;
}
```

I needed to do something like this when porting this [function](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer) from C to Rust. Thankfully, Rust has a handy function for that called [offset](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset). Here's how the above code will look in Rust:

```rust
unsafe fn get_nth(list: *mut object, n: isize) -> *mut object {
    let item = list.offset(n);
    item
}
```

That's it!!! Really straightforward and dangerous ðŸ™ƒ. 

* Easily cast a struct variable to another: Rust is a strict programming language. This can make learning the language a chore. One of the reasons why it's strict is because it tries to protect the programmer from the clever version of themselves. Let's say you want to convert a variable from one struct type to another. In Rust, we want to achieve something like this:

```rust
struct Person {
    firstname: String,
    lastname: String,
}

struct User {
    firstname: String,
    lastname: String,
}

fn convert_person_to_user(x: Person) {
    let u = x as User;
    println!("Firstname: {}, Lastname: {}", u.firstname, u.lastname);
}
```

When you run this code, the Rust compiler will throw an error. This error will occur despite both structs having the same fields. This is a good thing, but it might be a bit inconvenient. There are other ways you could achieve this, rather than using straight-up casting. But what if you are working with library code or C code and need to cast? We can achieve it with pointers. Here's the above function rewritten to use pointers.

```rust 
unsafe fn convert_to_user(mut x: Person) {
    let p = &mut x as *mut Person;
    let u = p.cast::<User>();
    println!("{}, {}", (*u).firstname, (*u).lastname);
}
```

It runs without any complaint. It isn't good Rust code, but sometimes you need something to just work.

I won't advise anyone to use the above methods to solve problems, but you might need them. It turned out that I needed them, and it was really worthwhile discovering and using them.

Speaking of casting...

#### 4. Adding extra fields to a struct
Imagine you're using a todo library that works with only one task. When you add a task, it throws away the previous one

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Task {
    content: String,
    is_done: bool
}

#[repr(C)]
struct Todo {
    add: unsafe fn(self_: *mut Todo, task: Task),
    current_task: Option<Task>,
}

unsafe fn add_task(todo: *mut Todo, task: Task) {
    (*todo).current_task = Some(task);
}

fn add_tasks(todo: *mut Todo) {
    let task1 = Task{content: String::from("Write"), is_done: false};
    let task2 = Task{content: String::from("Read"), is_done: true};
    unsafe {
        ((*todo).add)(todo, task1);
        ((*todo).add)(todo, task2);
    }
}
```

You'd use the above library like this:

```rust
fn create_todo() {
    let mut todo = Todo {add: add_task, current_task: None};
    let todo_ptr = &mut todo as *mut Todo;
    add_tasks(todo_ptr);
}
```

It works well, but what if the one task at a time is too limited for you? What if you want to keep track of previous tasks? The library function `add_tasks` cannot be changed and expects a specific input type. Is it possible to satisfy the library and satisfy your extra needs? It turns out both needs could be satisfied with a bit of casting trick. Here's how?

```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct CustomTodo {
    add: unsafe fn(self_: *mut Todo, task: Task),
    current_task: Option<Task>,
    previous_tasks: Vec<Task>,
}

unsafe fn custom_add_task(todo: *mut Todo, task: Task) {
    let custom_todo = todo as *mut CustomTodo;
    if (*custom_todo).current_task.is_some() {
        let prev = (*custom_todo).current_task.as_ref().unwrap().clone();
        (*custom_todo).previous_tasks.push(prev);
    }
    (*custom_todo).current_task = Some(task);
}

fn create_todo() {
    let mut custom_todo = CustomTodo{add: custom_add_task, current_task: None, previous_tasks: vec![]};
    let custom_todo_ptr = &mut custom_todo as *mut CustomTodo;
    unsafe {
        let custom_todo_ptr = custom_todo_ptr as *mut Todo;
        add_tasks(custom_todo_ptr);
    }
    for task in &(custom_todo.previous_tasks) {
        println!("Previous tasks\tContent: {}, is_done: {}", task.content, task.is_done);
    }
}
```

The above code shows how using casting has helped achieve both needs. To pull this off, we needed a little help from the library code. Notice the [`repr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-c-representation) attribute on both `Todo` and `CustomTodo` that tells the Rust compiler to treat both like a C struct. The attribute ensures that the compiler doesn't change the order of the struct's fields. A segmentation fault would have occurred if the library hadn't added the attribute to the `Todo` struct.

This struct manipulation is dangerous and shouldn't be used thoughtlessly in your code. There are ways to achieve the above intent without meddling in unsafe territory. Dealing with C code or FFI might call for a need for it.


### Conclusion
These lessons might look very ordinary, but they are special to me. Working on this project has made me a better programmer. 

Ironically, I started with praises about the simplicity of Postgres and then ended with some clever tricks. The biggest lesson here is to strive for simplicity, but you never know when a clever trick could come in handy. Where do you think I found the struct casting [trick](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/b1b13d2b524e64e3bf3538441366bdc8f6d3beda/src/backend/access/common/printtup.c#L72)?
