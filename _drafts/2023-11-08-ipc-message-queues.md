In the previous article, we covered [Unix Signals](https://goodyduru.github.io/os/2023/10/05/ipc-unix-signals.html) and its usage for IPC. In this article, a common asynchronous communication pattern and its implementation will be covered.

### Message Queues 
There are two types of message queues - System V and POSIX. There are lots of similarities between them, with minor differences. This article focuses on System V because it is the more widely supported type. 

In basic terms, a [message queue](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/6bc986ab839c844e78a2333a02e55f02c9e57935/ipc/msg.c#L49) is a linked list of messages. The OS can maintain several lists of messages which are each referenced by a unique integer key. Messages are sent via appending them to the list. They are received via popping them from the head of the list. This list is managed by the OS kernel and is stored in-memory. In-memory storage of the list allows for asynchronous communication. This means that a sender process and a receiver process do not need to be writing and reading from the same queue at the same time in order to communicate.

Before creating or accessing a message queue, a unique key has to be generated in a deterministic way. It is important that it is unique to avoid an error when creating a queue. It is also important that the same key is used by all the application processes to communicate with the same queue. A recommended way for generating a key is to call the [`ftok`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/ftok.3.html) function. This function accepts a file path and an integer. The file path must be an existing file, else an error will be returned. A recommended file path can be the application configuration file. The `ftok` function will return the same result as long as the file isn't deleted and recreated. It is possible for collisions to happen, but the chances of those happening are pretty slim.

Accessing or creating a message queue is done using the [`msgget`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgget.2.html) function. This function accepts a key and a flag. Creating a message queue is done by specifying **IPC_CREAT** in the flag. The message queue permission is defined in the flag. This permission has the same format as [file permissions](https://www.multacom.com/faq/password_protection/file_permissions.htm). For example, creating a message queue that grants only the effective user a write permission, and read permission to others is done by executing `msgget(key, IPC_CREAT | 0644)`. This creates a message queue where a process with it's userid not set to the queue owner's id can receive a message, but cannot send one. The `msgget` function returns the message queue identifier, which is used when sending and receiving messages from the queue.

You can view all the currently existing message queues in your OS by running `ipcs -q`.

Fundamentally, messages are sent and received as bytes using the [`msgsnd` and `msgrcv`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgsnd.2.html) functions. The `msgsnd` function accepts a message queue id which is returned by `msgget`, a pointer to the message struct, the size of the message and an integer flag. The message struct needs to include the type of the message which is an integer. The `msgsnd` function appends the message to the queue identified by the id specified in its first parameter. 

Message queues have a maximum size that is specified by the OS, which can be [configured](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.1?topic=unix-modifying-kernel-parameters-linux) by the user. This means that `msgsnd` will block if the queue is full. Preventing blocking can be done by specifying `IPC_NOWAIT` in the flag argument, which will make return an error instead.

Receiving a message is done using the `msgrcv` function. The difference between this function parameters and that of the `msgsnd` function is the message type. This type determines if the process wants to read any message (0), a specific message type (a positive integer), or a particular group of message (a negative integer). Setting the type to a negative integer reads any message whose type is less than or equal to the absolute value of the specified type. This function removes a message from the queue and copies it to the provided message buffer parameter.

The `msgrcv` function by default will block if the queue is empty/no message of the specified type(s). Blocking can be prevented if it's empty by specifying `IPC_NOWAIT` in the flag argument, which makes the function return an error. In Linux, if there's no message of the specified type(s), the first message can in the queue can be read if `MSG_EXCEPT` is specified in the flag argument.

Message queues can be removed and configured by the [`msgctl`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msgctl.2.html) function. The function also allows for reading a message queue metadata.

### Show me the code
This example will demonstrate two processes communicating using message queue in Python. Unfortunately, Python does not provide out of the box message queue support. This made me use the excellent [sysv-ipc](https://semanchuk.com/philip/sysv_ipc/#message_queue) module. You can find the pip package [here](https://pypi.org/project/sysv-ipc/).

Here's the client code:
```python
    import os

    import sysv_ipc

    ROUNDS = 100


    def run():
        path = '/tmp/example'
        fd = os.open(path, flags=os.O_CREAT)
        os.close(fd)
        key = sysv_ipc.ftok(path, 42)
        mq = sysv_ipc.MessageQueue(key, flags=sysv_ipc.IPC_CREAT, mode=0o644)
        msg_type = 10
        i = 0
        while i != ROUNDS:
            mq.send(b"ping", type=msg_type)
            print("Client: Sent ping")
            data, _ = mq.receive(type=(msg_type+1))
            data = data.decode()
            print(f"Client: Received {data}")
            i += 1
        mq.send(b"end", type=msg_type)


    run()
```
A temp file is (optionally) created to ensure that it exists. The ftok function is called with the file path and an integer. The message queue is (optionally) created and accessed. This returns a message queue object. A loop is ran where message containing a byte string and its type set to *msg_type* is sent. Message of a different type is then received. A different message type has to be specified to prevent a process from receiving a message sent by it. The message received is decoded and printed, and then the loop continues. The loop is ended when _ROUNDS_ messages are sent. Afterwards an _end_ message is sent to signify that the client is done.

Messages sent and received are byte strings and not regular strings, and thus have to be encoded and decoded accordingly.

Here's the server code

```python
    import os

    import sysv_ipc

    def run():
        path = '/tmp/example'
        fd = os.open(path, flags=os.O_CREAT) # create file
        os.close(fd)
        key = sysv_ipc.ftok(path, 42)
        mq = sysv_ipc.MessageQueue(key, flags=sysv_ipc.IPC_CREAT, mode=0o644)
        msg_type = 10
        data, _ = mq.receive(type=msg_type)
        data = data.decode()
        while data != 'end':
            print(f"Server: Received {data}")
            mq.send(b"pong", type=(msg_type+1))
            print(f"Server: Sent pong")
            data, _ = mq.receive(type=msg_type)
            data = data.decode()
        os.unlink(path)
        mq.remove()


    run()
```

The server code sets up the message queue similarly to the client code. Because `ftok` is called with exactly the same parameters as that of the client code, the key value will be the same. A message of the type *msg_type* is received from the message queue. A loop is ran which checks that the received message isn't equal to _end_. Inside this loop, the received message is printed and a message of a different type is sent to the queue. Message is then received and decoded and the loop is continued. 

The loop stops once the _end_ message is received. The file for generating the key and the message queue are deleted. The program then exits.

### Performance
Message queues are pretty fast. [IPC-Bench](https://github.com/goldsborough/ipc-bench#benchmarked-on-intelr-coretm-i5-4590s-cpu--300ghz-running-ubuntu-20041-lts) benchmarked 213,796 1KB messages per second on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4590S CPU @ 3.00GHz running Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS. That's fast enough for most inter-process communication needs.

### Demo Code
You can find my code on UDS on [GitHub](https://github.com/goodyduru/ipc-demos).

### Conclusion
Message Queues are a familiar communication pattern. Using them for your unidirectional or bi-directional inter-process communication needs is a good choice.
